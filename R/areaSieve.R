#' @title Apply a sieve to a raster layer
#' 
#' @description Applies an areal threshold to a raster layer. A threshold is supplied in square metres (to be generalized in future) and all pixel 'clumps' smaller than this threshold are deleted.
#' 
#' 
#' @param x. Input raster layer.
#' @param thresh Numeric. Areal threshold (in square metres). All pixel clumps smaller than thresh will be deleted.
#' @param directions Numeric. Define pixel neighbours using diagonals (diagonals=8; "Queen's case") or without diagonals (diagonals=4; "Rook's case").
#' @param ... Additional arguments to be passed to \link{overlay} (including filename to write to file).
#' @author Ben DeVries
#' @return raster with pixels in clumps smaller than that specified as thresh removed. All spatial parameters and data are otherwise identical to x.
#' @import raster
#' @import igraph
