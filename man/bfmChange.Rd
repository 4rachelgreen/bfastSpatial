\title{Extract breakpoints from bfm RasterBrick}
\usage{
bfmChange(bfm, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{bfm}{RasterBrick output from \code{\link{bfmSpatial}}. The 1st layer is the breakpoint timing and the 2nd is the change magnitude.}

\item{...}{Additional arguments to pass to \code{\link{writeRaster}}.}
}
\value{
RasterLayer with breakpoint timing per pixel. Breakpoint times are in the format yyyy.jjj (where y is year and j is JulianDay/365).
}
\description{
Creates a raster layer with breakpoint timing values from the output bfm raster brick
}
\details{
The output of this function can also be used as a parameter in the \code{\link{bfmMagn}} function to filter out pixels where no breakpoint was detected.
