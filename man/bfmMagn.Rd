\title{Extract change magnitude bfm RasterBrick}
\usage{
bfmMagn(bfm, change = NULL, thresh = NULL, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{bfm}{RasterBrick output from \code{\link{bfmSpatial}}. 1st layer is the breakpoint timing and the 2nd is the change magnitude.}

\item{change}{Optional: RasterLayer output from \code{\link{bfmChange}}. Used to mask out all non-breakpoints from magnitude RasterLayer.}

\item{thresh}{Numeric. Optional: threshold to apply to magnitude thresholds. Any magnitude values above this threshold will be excluded.}

\item{...}{Arguments to be passed to \code{\link{writeRaster}}.}
}
\value{
RasterLayer representing the change magnitude for all pixels, unless change filter is applied, in which case only representing breakpoint pixels.
}
\description{
Creates a raster layer representing the change magnitude (median of the residuals during the monitoring period) from a resulting bfm raster brick. Magnitude is calculated for all pixels regardless of whether a breakpoint was detected or not. This function allows for filtering based on a supplied change (breakpoint) raster.
}
\examples{
# load in raster brick
data(tura)

# run bfm on brick for monitoring period 2009 and using all available data as the stable history period.
bfm <- bfmSpatial(tura, start=c(2009,1))

# extract and plot change magnitude (continuous values)
magn <- bfmMagn(bfm)
plot(magn)

# extract magnitude only for pixels where breaktpoint were detected
change <- bfmChange(bfm)
magn.filt <- bfmMagn(bfm, change = change)
plot(magn.filt)

# extract breakpoint magnitudes for large changes (where dNDVI < -0.03)
magn.large <- bfmMagn(bfm, change = change, thresh = -0.03)
plot(magn.large)

if("rasterVis" \%in\% row.names(installed.packages())){
    library(rasterVis)
    levelplot(brick(magn, magn.filt, magn.large))
}
