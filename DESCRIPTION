Description: Pre-process gridded time-series data in order for them to be
    analyzed with change detection algorithms such as bfast. Uses classes from
    the raster package and includes utilities to run the algorithms and
    post-process the results.
Depends:
    R (>= 3.0.0),
    raster,
    parallel,
    bfast,
    gdalUtils,
